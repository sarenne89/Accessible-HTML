# Accessible-HTML

## Description 

Week 1's challenge involved editing an existing HTML and CSS file to be more accessible, adding alt tags to images as well as an aria-label for the hero banner image, which had been included using CSS rather than HTML (where alt tags could have been added). I have edited the title of the page to be more appropriate, and I have also condensed the CSS to include styles for particular nested elements, rather than having the same styles written for classes that are only applied once on a specific section of content.
